# Proposal 0: Template

## Abstract

This proposal suggests a new feature to improve user experience by implementing enhanced functionality in our system. The goal is to increase efficiency and provide users with better control over their privacy.

## Motivation

Users have requested more flexibility and control. Currently, the system lacks certain options that limit usability. This enhancement will address these issues and improve overall satisfaction.

## Specification

The feature will introduce:
- Customizable Settings: Users will be able to configure various settings based on their needs.
- Automated Notifications: To keep users updated, the system will send notifications for specific events.
- Enhanced Security: Additional layers of security will protect user data.

### Technical Details

- Backend: Changes in the database schema to store user preferences.
- Frontend: New UI elements in the settings panel for customization.
- APIs: Updated API endpoints to support the new feature.

## Drawbacks

- Increased Complexity: Adding new settings might require additional onboarding for users.
- Maintenance: The new feature will require regular updates and support.

## Alternatives

1. Partial Implementation: Implement only a subset of the proposed features.
2. User Training: Conduct sessions to help users adapt to the current limitations instead of adding new features.
