# Proposal 1: Add phone number

## Abstract

This proposal proposes the addition of a new feature that aims to enhance user experience by incorporating phone number.

## Motivation

Many services now require users to provide their phone numbers but lot of time it is useless. 
We do not need to input phone number into service (e.g. Packeta) when required code will be send via email too.

Our goal is to make sure that every Peter Horvath does not use a unique phone number unless he or she needs to, since a unique phone number can serve as a unique identifier of such Peter Horvath.

## Specification

The feature will introduce:
- Peter Horvath phone number

### Technical Details

- Prohne number: +420 777 777 777
- This phone number is magic and is acceped by all services and it is not possible to call here.

## Drawbacks

- Phone numbers can sometimes appear unexpected or fake, particularly in professional settings.

## Alternatives

1. Find another special number.
2. Use number from some nonkyc real CZ simcard what will nobody use for real purposes.
