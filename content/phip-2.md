# Proposal 2: Add SK address

## Abstract

This proposal proposes the addition of a new feature that aims to enhance user experience by incorporating SK permanent address.

## Motivation

All services now require users to provide their address but lot of time it is useless. 
We do not need to input address in to service (e.g. Gamma.app) when service is digital or when we are buying digital product or delivering someting via Packeta.

Our goal is to make sure that every Peter Horvath does not use a unique address unless he or she needs to, since a unique address can serve as a unique identifier of such Peter Horvath.

## Specification

The feature will introduce:
- Peter Horvath permanent address

### Technical Details

- Street: Vazovova
- House number: 7
- PSČ: 816 16
- City: Bratislava (Staré Mesto)
- Country: Slovakia

You can use it like: Vazovova 7, 816 16 Bratislava, Slovakia

## Drawbacks

- It may happen that occasionally something is inadvertently delivered to this address, but I do not see a problem with that.

## Alternatives

1. None
